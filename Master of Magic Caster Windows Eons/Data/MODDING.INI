[Elimination]
; The elimination feature is a system that will attempt to simplify game state by removing weak wizards from the game past midgame.
; The primary effect is other AI wizards declaring war on the elimination target, however, if they fail to completely conquer the target, and the target is reduced to a very few remaining cities, the target will voluntarily leave the game by retiring, or by losing their position through a rebellion.
; The primary purpose of this feature is to allow AI players to keep up expanding their empire size, instead of the world staying divided betweem 10+ smaller players who are no threat to the human player and don't lead to interesting gameplay once the human player conquered a few others and outclasses everyone in empire size. However, many endgame spells or effects also scale poorly with high player counts, such as global enchantments, which is one of the other reasons why this feature was necessary.
; To disable the feature entirely, simply set the number of desired wizards to 14 or higher.

However, there is a minimal value that prevents the feature from taking effect if the player count in the game was low from begin with, and the feature is not (yet) necessary.
EliminationMinimalStartingAmount=8
; The final goal of the feature is to reduce the number of wizards to half minues one, rounded up. (12 wizard games will set a final goal of 5, 13 wizard games a goal of 6 wizards remainining)
; This amount applies at the ending turn and beyond. Between the starting and ending turn, the goal scales down linearly.
; The Minimal Ending Amount is the number of wizards this feature's final goal cannot be lower than. (At 4, this means games below 9 players will always have a final goal of 4 players remaining)
EliminationMinimalEndingAmount=4
; Please note that it's not guarenteed that these goals are always met ingame. Sometimes the game state might be such that there aren't enough "weak" wizards to eliminate. So the usual amount of wizards surviving to the endgame will often be 1-2 higher than the "minimal ending amount".
; Number of turns required as an elimination target before a wizard can retire, assuming their city count is already below the threshold. (The number of cities required scales by the land size setting and is 1 for Tiny and Minimal, 2 for Small, 3 for Normal, 4 for Large and 5 for Huge and Maximal land size games.)
